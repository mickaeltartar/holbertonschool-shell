## <p align="center">**Description**</p>
### **Introduction**

<p>The shell is a command-line interface (CLI) used for interacting with a computer's operating system. It's a powerful tool that allows you to perform a variety of tasks, such as navigating your file system, managing files and directories, and running programs and scripts.<br>

There are many different types of shells available, but the most common one used on Unix-based systems is called the Bash shell. When you open a terminal or command prompt on your computer, you're interacting with the shell.</p>

### **Shell basic commands**
Here are some common Bash shell commands:<br>

- ls: Lists the files and directories in the current working directory.<br>
- cd: Changes the current working directory.<br>
- mkdir: Creates a new directory.<br>
- rm: Removes files or directories.<br>
- cp: Copies files from one location to another.<br>
- mv: Moves files from one location to another.<br>
- pwd: This command stands for "print working directory". It prints the full path of the current working directory to the terminal.<br>
- less: This command is used to view the contents of a file in the terminal. It allows you to scroll through the file and search for specific text.<br>
- file: This command is used to determine the type of a file. It outputs information about the file's format and content.<br>
- ln: This command is used to create a link between files. There are two types of links that can be created: hard links and symbolic links.<br>
- type: This command is used to determine the type of a command or shell keyword. It can tell you whether a command is a built-in shell command, an external binary, or an alias.<br>
- which: This command is used to locate the binary executable file that corresponds to a given command or program.<br>
- help: This command displays information about built-in shell commands. It can be used to display a summary of a command's usage and options.<br>
- man: This command displays the manual pages for a given command. The manual pages provide detailed information about a command's usage, options, and behavior.<br>
